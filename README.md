# Nice-Logo-SVG

## Description
The purpose of this project was to implement node.js, inquirer and jest in order to produce a logo from the terminal. This allowed me to create test by set up function base on shape and an color and test to see if the inputs met the standards of the test functions.

## Installation
- npm i inquirer@8.2.4

## Usage
The app presents the user with a prompt to input the text, shape, and color and based on this the logo is generated and and then the test is performed.
